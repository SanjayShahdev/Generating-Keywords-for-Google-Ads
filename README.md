# Generating-Keywords-for-Google-Ads

# Project Description:

Here, the inspiration is that we work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. We are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With my Python skills, I will efficiently create these keywords!

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
